## Ideas

* Travel - trip planner - weather api/road conditions api
  traffic-waze api

* Dating app, restaurant finder

* Help desk - it desk (messaging/events)

* Newsletter - blog - sign up for newsletter

* Discord clone

### Choice One

* Messaging / Socket Service  API weather notification. -
  socket
  -- authentication?
  -- RBAC?
  -- cache?
  -- AWS?
  --SNS+SQS - text / email service / notification service

### Choice Two

* Discord Server Clone - API calls, sockets/messaging

--- Use Inquirer?

-- RBAC
-- Auth0 / build out / roles
-- cache
-- general chat channel
--group channels

-- created rooms by Role
-- "break rooms" per roles

Stretch Goals:

--chat roulette

### Create your Pitch

## Notifyme-US

Summary of idea.

What problem or pain point does it solve? a. Keep it high level without going into too much detail. (3-4 sentences is enough)

* It creates a viable communication tool to be used by companies and or consumer use.

Minimum Viable Product (MVP) definition.

* A multi channel message service with query based notification based on user preferences.

#### What are the key strengths of each person on the team?

Raphael - research, basic buildout, sockets

Trace - asthetics/UI, research, docs search and find

Steven - sockets, API call and request/response

Mandela - sockets, messaging services

Julian - knowledgeable on many topics and experience

### How can you best utilize these strengths in the execution of your project?

Raphael - take time with planning. framework/UML and research before starting to build-out code.

Trace - pair programming, researching and sharing information, support

Steven - set standards on API calls/request/response and collaboration on combining the different modules together.

Mandela - pair programming on sockets and discussing and driving/navigating through the project build out.

Julian - Teach us, help us do better

### In which professional competencies do you each want to develop greater strength?

Raphael - improving my ability to articulate and use proper grammar to explain my thought process, UML and code.

Trace - Tools to improve coding ability

Steven - work on group communication and improve documentation write-ups

Mandela - improving work efficiency and time management.

Julian - Do better

### Knowing that every person in your team needs to understand all aspects of the project, how do you plan to approach the day-to-day work?

Group - Pair Programming, morning/afternoon/EOD stand-ups/updates.
      _ Constant communication througout the planning and building stages.
      - Schedule tasks, features, jobs, etc.

### Conflict Plan

* Speak / share concerns, ideas, thoughts, worries, etc with eachother and team building.

* What if there's a power outage? Send slack, email, notify team members of any change and / or emergency.

* Each group member gets a chance to speak ideas, thoughts, concerns, blockers

What will your team do if one person is taking over the project and not letting the other members contribute?

* Notify and have an intervention with the team member in an open safe space.

How will you approach each other and the challenges of the project knowing that it is impossible for all members to be at
  the exact same place in understanding and skill level?

* We will pair program and teach and learn from eachother throughout the planning and building out stages.

How will you raise concerns to members who are not adequately contributing?

* Notify and have an intervention with the team member in an open safe space.

How and when will you escalate the conflict if your resolution attempts are unsuccessful?

* 2/3 strikes/(pattern of behavior) and then take issues to Instructor

* How many people concern, group vote

* how many people to make changes, bring up issues.

Constant open communication/ Standups. Work as a team, don't be a Richard.

### Work Plan

* Constant open communication/ Standups.

* Allignment ? Find allignment ?

### Git Process

What components of your project will live on GitHub?

* Repo, folders, files, everything, full application buildout except node modules and .env.

How will you share the repository with your teammates?

* We created an organization and added all team members.

What is your Git flow?

* Each team member will clone down to local machine and work on separate development branches.

Will you be using a PR review workflow? If so, consider:

  How many people must review a PR?

* minimum two team members

  Who merges PRs?

  * Any team member with a second team member present

  How often will you merge?
